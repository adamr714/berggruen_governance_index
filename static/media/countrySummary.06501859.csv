Country,Summary
Argentina,"Argentina performs at the median on QoD, below average in terms of QoG, and well below average
in terms of QoL. In relation to its GDP, Argentina is an underachiever, especially with regard to QoG and QoL. Although the country has near average scores for mid- level input indicators such as civil society and environment and an above average score for feedback mechanisms, Argentina scores amongst the lowest for throughputs such as bureaucratic recruitment and for outputs such as crime control and education."
Australia,"Australia achieves very good performances for its QoD, QoG and QoL, always positioned among the top 8 countries in the sample. In terms of GDP, it overachieves in terms of all 3 high-level indices. Almost all its QoG-related sub-index scores are above 90. Potential challenges for Australia are indicated by the QoL sub-indices of business procedures and other public services, which, though lower than the country’s other sub-index scores, are nevertheless above the 38-country average."
Brazil,"Brazil ranks below the median for QoD and QoG, and falters substantially in its QoL performance, which
is in 2018 some 10 points lower than it was in 2004. In relation to its GDP, Brazil is an extreme underachiever in terms of QoL, as reflected in weak scores on education and crime control, in particular. Among the QoG mid-level indices, Brazil’s score on (non)politicized bureaucracy and bureaucratic recruitment are above average, as is its score for democratic feedback mechanisms."
Canada,"Canada is a strong overall performer, with top-10 scores for its performance on QoD, QoG and QoL. In relation to its GDP, Canada is an overachiever on all three indices, but especially on QoD, for which its scores on all sub-indices are higher than 80 points. Although Canada’s performance is above the 38-country average on all sub-indices, its scores for several, including other public services, is somewhat weaker."
Chile,"Chile’s performance ranks it at the average for QoD, above for QoG and somewhat below for QoL. In relation to its GDP, Chile achieves more than might be expected on QoG, but less than might be expected on QoL. These rankings are, however, marked by extremes within all three dimensions at the level of corresponding sub-indices. Within QoD for example, Chile’s scores are well above average for feedback mechanisms, but below average for other QoD sub-indices. Similarly within QoL, the country’s above average performance for business procedures, control of the shadow economy and public health has its counterpart in below average scores for education and control of crime."
China,"While China ranks among the bottom 12 for
its QoD and QoG performances, remaining there even
in relation to its GDP, it fares better in terms of QoL,
where it rises to the middle third of countries and is a
high overachiever in relation to its GDP. Ranking at the bottom for feedback mechanisms, China also experiences challenges pertaining to general and judicial impartiality and politicized bureaucracy. On the other hand, the country attains above average scores for crime control, education, other public services, and control of the shadow economy."
Colombia,"While Colombia performs below the average for QoD and QoG, its QoL score lies well below average. On all three high-level indices, Colombia scores lower than might be expected in relation to its GDP. While the country performs above average in the QoG sub-indices analytical capacity and coordination, it is hampered by particularly low scores on crime rates, education and bureaucratic recruitment."
Egypt,"Egypt performs in the bottom 10 on the QoD, QoG and QoL indices, though in relation to its GDP, it achieves what might be expected in relation to its GDP on QoG and QoL. More specifically, it ranks near the bottom on sub-indices such as analytical capacity, civil justice, coordination, environment, feedback mechanisms and impartiality of public officials. The country achieves a somewhat higher score on public health."
France,"France appears in the top 12 for QoD, QoG
and QoL, achieving more than might be expected given
its GDP, in terms of both QoD and QoL. Particularly strong performance is found in sub-indices such as civil society, impartiality, procedural efficiency and other (infrastructural) public services. Nonetheless, a score closer to the average for analytical capacity might indicate challenges."
Georgia,"Georgia ranks below average for QoD, slightly above for QoG, but just below for QoL, and significantly overachieving on QoG and QoL in relation to the country’s GDP. Behind these performances are wide variations within each dimension. In QoG, for example, whereas Georgia’s score on the politicized bureaucracy sub-index is among the lowest (meaning that the bureaucracy is highly politicized), its scores on most other sub-indices within
this dimension are near the average. Similarly in the QoL dimension, average performances on most sub-indices are counterbalanced by a weak score on education. It is worth mentioning that Georgia’s QoG and QoL scores showed
a strong increase between 2004 and 2012/13, and although they have since declined somewhat, the
scores remain higher."
Germany,"Germany is in the top five for its QoD, QoG and QoL performances and overachieves on all three indices in relation to its GDP. The country ranks near the top of the sample for civil justice, impartiality, analytical capacity, coordination and control of corruption, among other mid- level indicators."
Ghana,"Ghana exhibits a below average performance on all three governance dimensions, QoD, QoG and QoL, but, when level of economic development is taken into account, achieves more than might be expected, especially on QoG. It ranks well above the 38-country average for feedback mechanisms and just above or near the median on impartiality. Judicial impartiality, civil justice and (non)politicized bureaucracy. Ghana’s scores on all other sub-indices are below or well below average, with particular concern for corruption control and coordination within the QoG dimension and public health, environment and other public services in the QoL dimension."
India,"Despite a median QoD performance, India ranks among the bottom ten countries for QoG and QoL. In relation to its GDP, the country significantly overachieves
in terms of QoD, but performs only slightly better on
QoG and QoL than might be expected given its level of economic development. Its scores for business procedures, environment, and public health are particularly weak. However, India’s scores are above average in (lack of) politicized bureaucracy and bureaucratic recruitment."
Indonesia,"Performing slightly below average for QoD, Indonesia’s QoG and QoL performances are far below the 38-country average. When performance is considered in relation to GDP, the country underachieves on QoG and QoL, but not on QoD. In particular, the country faces serious challenges pertaining to tax collection capacity, analytical capacity and judicial impartiality among the QoG sub-indices and to education and public health among the QoL sub-indices. On a positive note, the country is a relatively strong performer in terms of environment and control of the shadow economy."
Israel,"Israel is a top-13 performer in terms of QoD,
QoL and QoG, performing at about the level expected in relation to its GDP on QoG, but below expectations on QoD and QoL. In terms of mid-level indicators, the country scores well above average for analytical capacity, general impartiality, judicial impartiality and public health. Scores on other mid-level indices fall at or above the mean, except for environment, the score for which is below average."
Italy,"Italy scores above the average on all three dimensions, though in relation to its GDP it underachieves on QoG and QoL. Strong scores for general and judicial impartiality in the QoG dimension are counterbalanced
by below average scores for analytical and tax collection capacity, procedural efficiency, corruption, bureaucratic recruitment and politicized bureaucracy. Similarly, above average scores on QoL sub-indices education, environment and public health coexist with a far below average score on other public services such as infrastructure."
Japan,"A fairly good performer overall, Japan lies within the top-15 of countries for QoD and ranks among the top-10 for QoG and QoL. In relation to its GDP, it is an underachiever on the QoD dimension, but an overachiever on QoG and QoL. Japan’s most notable achievements are found in the education, crime control, environment and other public services QoL sub-indices as well as in the (lack of) politicized bureaucracy, tax collection and procedural efficiency QoG sub-indices. In general, the country performs above or well above average for all mid-level indicators."
Jordan,"Jordan lies in the bottom-10 for its QoD performance but ranks closer to the median in QoG and QoL. While it remains an underachiever on QoD in terms of its GDP, the country is a high overachiever on QoG and an overachiever on QoL. The country scores significantly below average for analytical capacity, civil society, political engagement, environmental protection, tax collection capacity, and education. However, Jordan performs above average level in other areas: control of crime and the shadow economy, as well as public health."
Kazakhstan,"Kazakhstan’s QoD and QoG scores
are among the lowest 5, and its QoL score, though
better, remains below average. On all three dimensions, Kazakhstan is underachieving in relation to its GDP. The country’s strengths are analytical capacity, crime control and public health, for which it achieves near or above average scores. Yet, its scores on the remaining sub-indices are by and large significantly below average."
Kenya," Kenya ranks among the bottom-5 countries in
the QoG and QoL indices, but its QoD score brings it to bottom of the middle third. In relation to its GDP, the country overachieves on all three indices, especially QoD. Reflecting this, its scores on the political engagement sub-index in
the QoD dimension is above average, while its scores on analytical capacity is above average. Kenya’s particular challenges include civil justice, corruption, crime control, public health and other public services."
Mexico,"Mexico’s scores bring it below average on the QoD and QoG indices and significantly below average on the QoL index. In light of its GDP, Mexico is significantly underachieving on all three dimensions, especially QoG and QoL. Examining mid-level indicators, Mexico experiences serious challenges regarding crime control, analytical capacity, coordination, politicized bureaucracy and tax collection, among other sub-indices measured. However, the country performs near or above the average on business procedures, inflation control and public health."
Netherlands,"The Netherlands shows very high performances across all main indices, being the among the top 5 performers in terms of QoD and QoG and the number 2 performer in 2018 for QoL. Indeed, the country is an overachiever on all three dimensions in relation to its GDP. The country ranks at or close to the top for civil justice, control of corruption, general and judicial impartiality, analytical capacity and other (infrastructural) public services."
Nigeria,"Being the worst performer in the sample on the QoL index and second worst on the QoG index, Nigeria is also in the bottom eight in QoD. In relation to its GDP, Nigeria is achieving no more than expected. The country’s challenges are evident in well below average scores on QoG sub-indices such as analytical capacity, coordination, control of corruption, impartiality and tax collection capacity and in similarly low scores on QoL sub-indices such as crime control and public health."
Norway,"Norway performs exceptionally well on all three indices, ranking in the top three on all. In relation to its GDP, Norway performs as expected on QoL and slightly better than expected on QoD and QoG. Particularly notable are high scores on general and judicial impartiality, procedural efficiency and analytical capacity."
Pakistan,"Pakistan lies in the middle third of countries on QoD, but at the bottom of the ranking on QoG and second from bottom on QoL. In relation to its GDP, it achieves notably more than would be expected on QoD, as expected on QoG and slightly above expectations on QoL. The country experiences a wide range of challenges on almost all of the mid-level indicators, particularly civil justice, control of corruption, crime control, environment, public health and other (infrastructural) public services, not to mention procedural efficiency and tax collection."
Philippines,"The Philippines performs below the
mean on the QoD index and well below on QoG and
QoL. In relation to its GDP, the country achieves scores slightly above expectations on QoD, somewhat less than expected on QoG, and as expected on QoL. On most mid-level indicators, the country scores significantly below average, especially on civil justice, crime control, control
of the shadow economy and analytical capacity. However, environmental protection, bureaucratic recruitment, (lack of) politicized bureaucracy, and procedural efficiency scores are near or slightly above average."
Russia,"Given its low rankings on the QoD and QoG indices, Russia’s QoL performance is comparatively high, though still falling below the median. In terms of its GDP, Russia significantly underachieves on all three dimensions. The country’s highest achievement is its performances in education, but it faces continued challenges in terms of environment, other public services, judicial impartiality, feedback mechanisms and shadow economy control."
Saudi Arabia,"Saudi Arabia is situated near the bottom of the QoD index and at the average in terms of QoG
and QoL. The latter two scores are based on average or somewhat above average scores for control of crime and the shadow economy, other public services and public health, as the mid-level indicators show. In relation to its GDP, Saudi Arabia achieves far less on all three high-level dimensions than might be expected."
South Africa,"South Africa ranks at the median on the QoD and below the median on the QoG index, while faring far worse on QoL. In relation to its GDP, the country overachieves on QoD, but underachieves on QoG and QoL, the latter by far. The mid-level indicators reveal
that, although South Africa scores at or above average
for feedback mechanisms, analytical capacity, judicial impartiality, civil justice and tax collection capacity, its most serious challenges in terms of QoG include bureaucratic recruitment, procedural efficiency, impartiality and corruption and in terms of QoL include crime, education and public health."
South Korea,"While South Korea performs just above the average for QoD, it is in the top- 9 of countries with regard to both its QoG and QoL scores. In terms of its GDP, this means that it underachieves slightly on QoD,
but overachieves on QoG and QoL. Its strongest scores are registered for civil justice, crime control, other public services and education. Challenges might be indicated by somewhat lower – but still above average – scores for corruption control and feedback mechanisms."
Spain,"On all three of the main indices, Spain performs above the average, but as might be expected in relation
to its GDP. In particular, the country maintains a well
above average score pertaining to civil society, as well as public health and other public services. However, a below average score on analytical capacity and average scores on corruption control, impartiality, tax collection and a politicized bureaucracy are some areas of concern for Spain."
Sweden,"Sweden’s scores place it at the top of
the 38-country sample on all three high- level indices. Furthermore, the country is an overachiever on all three dimensions relative to its GDP. None of Sweden’s scores fall below the mean."
Switzerland,"Switzerland scores among the top five in all three main indices. In relation to its GDP, the country performs just as expected, though achieving slightly more on QoD. All its scores are above or well above average. Particular strengths include coordination, impartiality and corruption control among the QoG sub-indices and education, environment, other public services and crime control among the QoL indices."
Turkey,"Turkey is ranked among the bottom 5 countries for its QoD performance and well below average on QoG and QoL indices. It is a significant underachiever on all three dimensions when its GDP is taken into consideration. Though the country’s score for public health is above the median, its performance on the environment and inflation is well below, as is its performance on feedback mechanisms judicial and general impartiality."
Ukraine,"With a below average performance on QoD and QoL, Ukraine ranks in the bottom five on the QoG index. In relation to GDP, the country performs just about as expected on all three dimensions. In terms of sub-indices, Ukraine’s scores are above average on civil justice and public health. Yet, its scores are well below average on nearly all QoG sub-indices, especially analytical capacity, coordination and procedural efficiency."
United Kingdom,"The United Kingdom ranks
among the top ten countries on all three high-level indices. Furthermore, the UK achieves more on all three dimensions than might be expected in light of its GDP. The country exhibits excellence especially in analytical capacity
(holding the highest score among the 38 countries), civil society, and coordination."
United States,"The United States ranks in the top-12 of countries on the QoD, QoG and QoL indices. In relation to its GDP, the country performs just above expectations
on QoD, but just below on QoG and QoL. Among the QoG sub-indices, above average scores on procedural efficiency and bureaucratic recruitment are offset somewhat by an average score on coordination and a below average score on analytical capacity."
Vietnam,"Although Vietnam ranks second to last on
the QoD index and performs well below average on the QoG index, it ranks within the middle third in terms of
QoL. In relation to its GDP, Vietnam is an underachiever
in QoD, achieves more than expected in QoG, and is a
high overachiever on QoL. Within the QoD dimension, the country’s score on feedback mechanisms is among the lowest of all countries included in the study. As for QoG, the only sub-index that reaches a score above 30 is analytical capacity. Vietnam performs above average on crime control, education and control of the shadow economy, but its performance on public health falls well below."
